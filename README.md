# OneSignal Android Sample

OneSignal makes engaging customers simple and is the fastest, most reliable service to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.

This project demonstrates sending push notifications using **OneSignal Android SDK**. You can use this project as a boilerplate or reference to start your project.

## üö¶ Getting started

This project assumes that you already have a OneSignal app created with push notifications setup. If you don't yet have a OneSignal app, [create one](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/apps-organizations#create-an-app) first, then follow the steps below to integrate the OneSignal SDK into your [Android](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/android-sdk-setup) or [iOS](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-setup) app.

### Initialize OneSignal 

https://github.com/OneSignalDevelopers/onesignal-android-sample/blob/3e5493fe01b67eb294ff071d695c081479d0c895/app/src/main/java/com/onesignal/sample/android/MainApplication.kt#L8-L14

### Enable push subscription

### Send push notification

```bash
## Send notification
# https://documentation.onesignal.com/reference/create-notification
curl -X "POST" "http://notifications" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -u '<Your REST API Key>:' \
     -d $'{
  "headings": {
    "en": "ü•≥üçæüéä"
  },
  "included_segments": [
    "Subscribed Users"
  ],
  "app_id": "<Your APP ID>",
  "contents": {
    "en": "You recieved your first push!"
  },
  "url": "https://onesignal.com"
}'
```
